A repair tool for Neo4j Lucene indexes in case the _id_ field goes missing in some documents.

!!!THIS TOOL IS NOT SAFE TO USE ON A RUNNING DATABASE!!!

You can use this in two modes. One is a standalone tool from the command line, as in

java -jar lucene-store-utils.jar <path-to-database> [repair]

with [repair] being an optional argument which, if present, will remove any documents it
finds without the _id_ field, in all indexes created by the database.

You can also use it as an embedded repair tool - see the TestCorrectness tests for sample use.
